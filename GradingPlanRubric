Grade LEVEL for students

LEVEL 1 - (Grades 01 and 02)
Purely introduction and no electronics used here.
There is no actual electronic lessons here since, 3D printing / drawing
or the most basic classes would go here.

Level 1 is mostly CAD and 3D Printing CAD so the closest to electronics would be wiring and only instructors
would be able to do the electronics while explaining the students on the basics 
of electricity and pure basics of electronics.


LEVEL 2 -  (Grades 03 and 04)
Purely Electronic Basics
- Resistors, Capacitors, and Inductors
- Applied Math to Electronics
- No Programming, all electronic components, and instructions provided must be mandatory
(Grades 3 and 4 are not going to CAD and model their own PCBs)
- Only Electronics goes here


LEVEL 3 - (Grades 05 and 06)
Introduce Arduino IDE and Arduino UNO and ESP32 and  Microcontroller
- Start with the INTRO files
- C++ Programming would go here
- Maybe Python? Micropython for Python Programming on ESP32 would go here
- Servo Motors
- LEDs and Electronics Parts
- Purely Breadboard and Breadboard circuits would go here

LEVEL 4 -  (Grades 07 and 08)
More Projects Using Arduino IDE or ESP32
Here, This doesn't use the breadboard much 
- Client vs Server Model
- Combining 3D Modeling, AI Coding, and Electronics Classes Level 1 2 and 3 goes here
- Making their own personal projects
- Introduce Wireless Communications / 
- Bluetooth Communications


LEVEL 5 - (Grades 09 and 10)
This is the concluding lessons and where students make their own projects
This is a continuation of Level 4 and more advanced, but there will still be files here for 
- More Soldering classes
- More 



LEVEL 6 -  (Grades 11 and 12)
The most fun and the most freedom based level, students have the most freedom here

Students get to make their own projects, no help (minimal help required)
