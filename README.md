These files and folders are all Projects and Coursework for the development and design of the Electronics and Microcontroller classes for students
of Caution Tape Robotics Club

These are all the projects to help improve childrens education in the field of STEM (Mainly Physics and Engineering)
NOTE:  The firmware board used to program the electronics is  ESP32 - Freenove - WROVER

Framework is always ARDUINO (Arduino Programming is done on these boards)

I selected Freenove, the WROVER Kit as it is the easiest to program and not only focuses on simple electronics, but also components
for Robotics Engineering for students

For the VERY BEGINNING LESSONS AND START OF THE CLASS MATERIALS:
Start with files such as ESP32 Intro, or Intro LED Button,  or Intro to Communications, as they are the easiest and the beginning of using
the ESP32 and the connections and computer design.

There will also be video game design for Unreal Engine in the future.
